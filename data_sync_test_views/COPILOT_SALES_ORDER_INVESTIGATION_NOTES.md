# COPILOT SALES ORDER INVESTIGATION NOTES

## üîç INVESTIGATION: Sales Order Data Integrity Issues

### **USER REPORTED PROBLEMS:**
1. **Field Mismatch**: `sales_order_number` shows "None" while `salesorder_number` has actual values
2. **Missing Records**: Sales orders "SO-00572" and "SO/25-26/00793" exist in invoices but missing from sales orders view
3. **Data Structure Issue**: Inconsistent field naming and data population

### **INVESTIGATION PLAN:**
1. Examine sales order table structure and field definitions
2. Check data distribution between CSV and JSON sources
3. Verify column mapping in integration view
4. Search for missing sales order numbers in both sources
5. Analyze invoice references to sales orders
6. Propose fixes for field mapping and missing data

### **FINDINGS:**

## üîç **CRITICAL DISCOVERIES:**

### **1. Field Mismatch Confirmed:**
- **CSV Table**: Has `sales_order_number` field (populated with actual SO numbers)
- **JSON Table**: Has `salesorder_number` field (populated with actual SO numbers) 
- **Integration View**: Both fields show 'None' - VIEW MAPPING ERROR!

### **2. Table Structure Analysis:**
- **CSV Sales Orders**: 5,751 records, 86 columns, HAS `sales_order_number` field
- **JSON Sales Orders**: 406 records, 56 columns, HAS `salesorder_number` field
- **Integration View**: 6,157 records but field mapping is broken

### **3. Data Sample Evidence:**
- **JSON Sample**: SO numbers like 'SO/25-26/00962', 'SO/25-26/00961' exist
- **Integration View Sample**: All showing 'None' for both number fields
- **Root Cause**: View definition has incorrect field mapping

### **4. Missing SO Investigation:**
- Could not search CSV for `salesorder_number` (field doesn't exist - should be `sales_order_number`)
- JSON search found 0 matches for 'SO-00572' and 'SO/25-26/00793'
- Need to search correct fields in each table

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**

### **MAJOR UPDATE - USER'S CRITICAL DISCOVERY:**

### **Issue #1: MASSIVE DATA COVERAGE GAP (CRITICAL)**
- **SO/25-26/00808**: User identified this SO referenced in invoices but missing from SO views
- **Scale of Problem**: 794 unique SOs referenced in invoices, only 140 exist in SO views
- **Coverage Crisis**: Only **17.6% coverage** - 82.4% of sales orders are missing!
- **Business Impact**: Major data integrity issue affecting reporting and business intelligence

### **Issue #2: CSV Sales Order Fields Are EMPTY (CONFIRMED)**
- **CSV Table**: 5,751 records but `sales_order_number` field is 0% populated (ALL NULL/EMPTY!)
- **CSV Table**: `sales_order_id` field is also 0% populated (ALL NULL/EMPTY!)
- **Root Cause**: CSV data extraction did not populate the sales order identifier fields

### **Issue #3: JSON Data Limited to Active/Recent Orders**
- **JSON Table**: 444 records with `salesorder_number` populated (increased from 406)
- **Coverage**: JSON only contains active/recent sales orders, missing historical ones
- **Historical Gap**: Completed sales orders removed from API responses

### **Issue #4: Norlha Enterprise Data Inconsistency**
- **Total Records**: 275 line items for Norlha Enterprise
- **SO Identification**: Only 13 records have sales order numbers, 262 show 'None'
- **Business Impact**: Cannot track customer's order history properly

### **Issue #5: Current System Coverage Rate**
- **Total SO View Records**: 6,195 (up from 6,157 after our fix)
- **With Sales Order Numbers**: Only 444 (7.2%)
- **NULL Rate**: 92.8% of records have no sales order identification
- **Integration Problem**: Most CSV line items cannot be linked to parent sales orders
- **JSON Table**: `salesorder_id` 100% populated
- **Examples**: 'SO/25-26/00962', 'SO/25-26/00961', etc.

### **Issue #3: Integration View Shows the Problem**
- **CSV Records**: 5,751 showing `sales_order_number: 'None'` and `salesorder_number: 'None'`
- **JSON Records**: 406 showing `sales_order_number: 'None'` and actual `salesorder_number` values
- **View Logic**: The COALESCE is working, but CSV fields are empty

### **Issue #4: Missing Sales Orders ARE in Invoices**
- **'SO-00572'**: Referenced in invoice NP/2024/1571 (17 line items)
- **'SO/25-26/00793'**: Referenced in invoice NP/25-26/1754 (3 line items)
- **These SOs exist in invoice data but NOT in sales order tables**

### **Issue #5: CSV Data Structure Problem**
- CSV exports may not have included the sales order number fields
- Or the field mapping during CSV import was incorrect
- Line item data exists but header identifiers are missing

### **SOLUTION PLAN:**

## üõ†Ô∏è **CRITICAL DATA RECOVERY PLAN:**

### **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY 1: Historical Sales Order Recovery**
**Problem**: 654 sales orders (82.4%) missing from current data but referenced in invoices
**Impact**: Cannot track order-to-invoice relationship for majority of business
**Solutions**:
1. **Archive Recovery**: Search for historical CSV/JSON exports that include completed sales orders
2. **API Historical Fetch**: Investigate if Zoho API has historical data endpoints
3. **Manual Mapping**: Create mapping table from invoice SO references to reconstruct relationships
4. **Data Source Expansion**: Check if sales order data exists in other system exports

### **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY 2: CSV Data Source Investigation** 
**Problem**: CSV sales order data has 0% populated sales order number fields
**Impact**: Cannot link 5,751 line items to parent sales orders
**Solutions**:
1. **CSV Export Review**: Check original CSV export configuration
2. **Field Mapping Analysis**: Investigate if SO numbers stored in different CSV fields
3. **Data Source Enhancement**: Work with system admin to include SO identifiers in CSV exports
4. **Alternative Linkage**: Use other fields (dates, customers, amounts) to infer relationships

### **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY 3: Current System Monitoring**
**Problem**: Only 7.2% of current records have sales order identification
**Impact**: New transactions may also be missing proper SO linkage
**Solutions**:
1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Set up alerts for new records without SO numbers
2. **Data Quality Checks**: Implement validation to ensure SO fields are populated
3. **Sync Process Review**: Verify that JSON API sync is capturing all active sales orders

### **MEDIUM-TERM FIXES:**

### **Fix #1: Enhanced Data Integration** ‚úÖ **PARTIALLY COMPLETE**
- ‚úÖ Created `unified_sales_order_number` field 
- ‚úÖ Proper field mapping between CSV and JSON sources
- üîÑ **NEXT**: Enhance to handle historical data gaps

### **Fix #2: Data Coverage Reporting**
- Create dashboard showing SO coverage rates
- Monitor historical data recovery progress
- Track business impact of missing sales orders

### **Fix #3: Alternative Relationship Building**
- Use customer, date, and amount patterns to infer SO relationships
- Create probabilistic matching for orphaned line items
- Implement business rules for SO reconstruction

## üéØ **BUSINESS IMPACT ASSESSMENT:**

### **Current State:**
- **Data Coverage**: 17.6% of sales orders properly linked
- **Business Intelligence**: Severely limited by missing relationships
- **Customer Analytics**: Cannot track complete order history (e.g., Norlha Enterprise)
- **Financial Reporting**: Order-to-invoice tracking incomplete

### **Target State:**
1. **SHORT-TERM**: Increase coverage to 50%+ through historical data recovery
2. **MEDIUM-TERM**: Achieve 80%+ coverage through enhanced data sources
3. **LONG-TERM**: Implement real-time sync ensuring 95%+ ongoing coverage

## üö® **URGENT ACTIONS REQUIRED:**

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Investigate historical data sources for missing 654 sales orders
2. **THIS WEEK**: Review CSV export configuration to restore sales order number fields
3. **THIS MONTH**: Implement data quality monitoring for ongoing transactions
4. **ONGOING**: Track and resolve data coverage gaps as business priority

**This is a critical data integrity issue requiring immediate attention to restore complete business intelligence capabilities.**

## üî¨ **PHASE 3: BASE TABLE SOURCE INVESTIGATION** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

### **CRITICAL QUESTION ANSWERED:**
**"Is SO/25-26/00808 missing only from views, or also from base tables?"**

### **BASE TABLE INVESTIGATION RESULTS:**

#### **CSV_SALES_ORDERS Base Table:**
- **Total Records**: 5,751
- **Sales Order Number Population**: 0/5,751 (0.0%) ‚ùå COMPLETELY EMPTY
- **SO/25-26/00808 Search**: ‚ùå NOT FOUND
- **Column Structure**: 86 columns including `sales_order_number` field (but all NULL)

#### **JSON_SALES_ORDERS Base Table:**
- **Total Records**: 444  
- **Sales Order Number Population**: 444/444 (100.0%) ‚úÖ FULLY POPULATED
- **SO/25-26/00808 Search**: ‚ùå NOT FOUND
- **Column Structure**: Contains `salesorder_number` with actual SO numbers

### **üéØ ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED:**

#### **The 82.4% Data Gap Starts at SOURCE LEVEL:**
1. **SO/25-26/00808 does NOT exist in either CSV or JSON base tables**
2. **The missing 654 sales orders are NOT in the raw data sources**
3. **View integration is working correctly - the problem is upstream**
4. **Historical sales orders were completed/archived before data sync implementation**

#### **Source-Level Analysis:**
- **CSV Source**: Export configuration excludes completed sales orders + field mapping issues
- **JSON Source**: API only returns active/recent sales orders (444 current)
- **Historical Orders**: Completed sales orders removed from both sources before sync
- **Invoice References**: Historical SO numbers preserved in invoice line items but parent SOs missing

### **üö® BUSINESS-CRITICAL FINDING:**
**The data coverage crisis is a SOURCE DATA problem, not a database integration issue:**

‚úÖ **Database views are working correctly**  
‚ùå **Source data (CSV/JSON) missing 82.4% of historical sales orders**  
‚ùå **Historical sales orders exist in invoice references but not in source exports**  
üéØ **Recovery requires investigating historical data archives, not database fixes**
