SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records, 
       COUNT(sales_order_number) as populated_numbers,
       COUNT(sales_order_number) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as population_rate
FROM csv_sales_orders;

-- Verify specific sales order exists
SELECT sales_order_id, sales_order_number, order_date, status 
FROM csv_sales_orders 
WHERE sales_order_number LIKE '%SO/25-26/00808%' 
LIMIT 5;
```

### Test Customer Payments
```sql
-- Check CustomerPayment ID and CustomerID population
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records,
       COUNT(customer_payment_id) as payment_ids,
       COUNT(customer_id) as customer_ids
FROM csv_customer_payments;
```

### Test Purchase Orders
```sql
-- Check Quantity fields population
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records,
       COUNT(quantity_ordered) as qty_ordered,
       COUNT(quantity_received) as qty_received
FROM csv_purchase_orders;
```
