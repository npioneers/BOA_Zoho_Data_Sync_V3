GLOBAL RUNNER SIMPLIFICATION SUMMARY

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Global runner was passing complex parameters to JSON2DB sync
- Using full_sync_workflow() method with multiple parameters
- This was causing errors and failures

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
- Simplified JSON2DB sync call to just: populate_tables()
- No parameters passed - uses package's own defaults
- Same exact method used when running manually
- Lets JSON2DB sync handle its own configuration

CHANGES MADE:
1. API Sync: ✓ Fixed incremental logic (since_timestamp=None)
2. JSON2DB Sync: ✓ Simplified to populate_tables() call
3. Directory Execution: ✓ All packages run from their own directories
4. Configuration: ✓ Each package uses its own defaults

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- API sync: ~21 invoices (true incremental)
- JSON2DB sync: Works like manual execution
- Database: Gets updated with fresh data
- Freshness check: Shows fresh data after sync

KEY PRINCIPLE:
"When a package works perfectly manually, don't overcomplicate it in automation"
