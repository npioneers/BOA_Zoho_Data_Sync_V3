# Resolved Issues Log

## ðŸ”§ RESOLVED ISSUES

### 1. Payment Entity Import Issues (RESOLVED)
**Problem:** Customer Payments and Vendor Payments were not being imported from CSV
**Root Cause:** Mapping mismatch between expected and actual CSV column names
**Solution Applied:**
- Updated `CUSTOMER_PAYMENTS_CSV_MAP` mapping:
  - `'Payment ID'` â†’ `'CustomerPayment ID'`
  - `'Customer ID'` â†’ `'CustomerID'`
- Updated `VENDOR_PAYMENTS_CSV_MAP` mapping:
  - `'Payment ID'` â†’ `'VendorPayment ID'`
**Result:** Both entities now import correctly (1,123 and 439 headers respectively)

### 2. Status Field Mapping (RESOLVED)
**Problem:** Purchase Orders and Credit Notes had missing Status field population
**Root Cause:** Incorrect CSV column mapping for status fields
**Solution Applied:**
- Purchase Orders: `'Purchase Order Status': 'Status'`
- Credit Notes: `'Credit Note Status': 'Status'`
**Result:** 100% status field population confirmed for all entities
